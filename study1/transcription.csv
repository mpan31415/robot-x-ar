P12_after4,"I guess you can also read if you want. Basically it's pretty much asking if the virtual rendering here helped at all with the task. Maybe not all of them helped. And yeah, if you have any comments on any of them you can just, we can discuss. The first one I think a little bit, but actually most of the time I wasn't looking at, yeah I was focusing on the dog actually. But when I see that the arm and this arm is in the same direction, I just feel it more secure I think. You mean the human arm but in a vertical direction? The virtual arm and this arm. I mean I think the second one when you match it with the same angle, it looks the same when it, yeah the angle of this arm and that arm is the same. So it feels more, I think it feels more secure when I try to adjust my movement. Ah, okay. So you were were you using that one at all? Like maybe to check? Just to check. Randomly check. But most of the time I wasn't looking at the arm. Okay, that's interesting. Yeah, so the second question is yes. I think the virtual is better. Oh yeah, so the yellow arm was like the human arm. So that was the vertical one like, and then we showed one condition of the robot arm, which was in this direction. The yellow one was the first one, right? So the first and the second was both the yellow arm. Okay, okay. Yeah, I think it's the yellow arm basically. Yeah, so the human arm. Do you know really why? Do you have a reason for that? I don't know, it's just feelings. I mean, because when I was doing the experiment, I only know that it's the yellow arm, I didn't know it was representing the human arm. Oh, okay. Okay, no worries. Yeah, it's just ranking, you can see. Yeah, if you feel like the, so I think if you mentioned the, so yeah, so vertical human arm, if you think that's the, that's the one where you mentioned like you felt more secure, you put that top. So, which was the horizontal human arm? It's also the yellow arm, but in the horizontal. I think it was the first one. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I will type the rest. I'll just type yes. Thanks for the verbal feedback, that's very helpful. This is Anthony, by the way. Okay, hi. Which class you are doing now? Exploratory now. Oh, that's fast. Yes, very. It's good. Yeah."
