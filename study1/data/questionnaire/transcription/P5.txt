So with these two last task, the drawing and the grabbing objects, do you think they were easier or more difficult compared to the pointing task.

Speaker 2 
For the grabbing one? The grabbing one is easier than the pointing, but the marker 1 is harder than the pointing.

Speaker 1 
And you can you tell why?

Speaker 2 
Because like for the marker, I cannot see how far is it, like there is no red line or anything, if I remember. So like, I don't know like if the marker already touch the whiteboard or not. And, and because like, I think there is a little bit delay when the marker touch the whiteboard. So like, I don't know, like if it's already been, you know, draw or not. Yeah, but like for the grabbing one, because like it change color.So like I already know the exact, okay, it's already been grabbing.

Speaker 1 
Okay, I think you also notice that when you are drawing something on a surface, you have a feeling of you're touching something. In this case, you're drawing on the air, so there is a lack of hectic feedback. Yeah, you don't.That's another issue.Some participants comment like, there is nothing to tell you.You're touching it.True.

Speaker 2 
Maybe like if there is, you know, like a sound of the robot arm hitting the arm or it will be.

Speaker 1 
Helpful. You can use other kind of. Yes. Okay. That's a some participants also mentioned that like some kind of audio feedback. Or some visualization of besides a red line to tell you when you are close to the surface.

Speaker 2 
You mean like when drawing?

Speaker 1 
Yeah, there is some, when you use VR in some applications, when you want to reach something, usually there is a big circle and then it becomes smaller. It tells you how close you are from what you want to. And essential. Maybe if we implement that, we want just to see your interaction with the drawing and grabbing. What about the red line was helpful? When you use.

Speaker 2 
Powerpoint, I think it's more than enough Powerpoint thing. It's just like the di direct the direction is what holdings me back at the first station. Okay, like I don't, I cannot figure that. Like I go down, it's go up, but when I go up, it's go down. Like what do you.

Speaker 1 
So what the strategies do you use when you were pointing, like to move your arm? What kind of thinking what you doing?

Speaker 2 
So like, I only saw how the robot move. Like I don't remember it, but like when I move here and then I go, then I memorize it. Oh, so like if I go here, the robot will move there.

Speaker 1 
Okay. What about the holograms? They were they helpful.

Speaker 2 
On for me, the most helpful one is the third.

Speaker 1 
One. Okay. Yeah, the vertical are different.

Speaker 2 
Okay. The this the second one, like, because sometimes I move my arm too much, the second one like will tell me like your arm is like this, you know, because show me the picture.

Speaker 1 
Of give you a sense of a space. Some participants also mentioned that like you, it might not help you directly, but you give you a sense of space.

Speaker 2 
Yeah, like don't move your up too far.

Speaker 1 
So error robot can reach. Yes, maybe on some unconsciously you want thinking that way. Yeah, true.

Speaker 2 
Like I occasionally see that arm a little bit, but like for the robot arm, I didn't even see it. Like I just.

Speaker 1 
Yeah, I, yeah, it was your last dance. Maybe already. You were very good anyway. Maybe.

Speaker 2 
Yeah, but like, I do feel like if the robot arm is not going at this physical arm, like it's not helpful at all. Okay, that it's already hard for me to figure out my own hand. But like when the hologram change into the robot arm, it's making me harder. Yeah, like direction different and then the arm is different also.

Speaker 1 
Yeah. Okay. What?
