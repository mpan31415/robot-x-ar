P12_after4,"I guess you can also read if you want. Basically it's pretty much asking if the virtual rendering here helped at all with the task. Maybe not all of them helped. And yeah, if you have any comments on any of them you can just, we can discuss. The first one I think a little bit, but actually most of the time I wasn't looking at, yeah I was focusing on the dog actually. But when I see that the arm and this arm is in the same direction, I just feel it more secure I think. You mean the human arm but in a vertical direction? The virtual arm and this arm. I mean I think the second one when you match it with the same angle, it looks the same when it, yeah the angle of this arm and that arm is the same. So it feels more, I think it feels more secure when I try to adjust my movement. Ah, okay. So you were were you using that one at all? Like maybe to check? Just to check. Randomly check. But most of the time I wasn't looking at the arm. Okay, that's interesting. Yeah, so the second question is yes. I think the virtual is better. Oh yeah, so the yellow arm was like the human arm. So that was the vertical one like, and then we showed one condition of the robot arm, which was in this direction. The yellow one was the first one, right? So the first and the second was both the yellow arm. Okay, okay. Yeah, I think it's the yellow arm basically. Yeah, so the human arm. Do you know really why? Do you have a reason for that? I don't know, it's just feelings. I mean, because when I was doing the experiment, I only know that it's the yellow arm, I didn't know it was representing the human arm. Oh, okay. Okay, no worries. Yeah, it's just ranking, you can see. Yeah, if you feel like the, so I think if you mentioned the, so yeah, so vertical human arm, if you think that's the, that's the one where you mentioned like you felt more secure, you put that top. So, which was the horizontal human arm? It's also the yellow arm, but in the horizontal. I think it was the first one. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I will type the rest. I'll just type yes. Thanks for the verbal feedback, that's very helpful. This is Anthony, by the way. Okay, hi. Which class you are doing now? Exploratory now. Oh, that's fast. Yes, very. It's good. Yeah."
P12_exploratory,"Yeah, you can answer, too. You can ask him. Okay. Cool. I guess in general, the final two tasks, was it more difficult than the reaching, or was it less difficult than... What do you think? I think it's more difficult. Okay. Any specific reasons? Because I think for the first two tasks, you just have to approach one point. Yeah. But for the second, the grabbing one, maybe you're still approaching the same point, but the drawing one is different. It's completely different. Yeah. So it's like, yeah, the direction is also a little confusing. Ah, okay. And the grabbing one is... I don't know. It's hard to determine when to start to grab. Because in my perspective, from my perspective, I see that my hand is already trying to, you know, it's already interfering with the object, but when I try to grab it, it's not so. Right. If there is, like, an indication. So, for example, when it's ready to grab it, you know, like... Change color. Change color. A bit more indicative in terms of telling me when to grab or where to stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and I guess, like, yeah, that's probably the main limitation with that task. You don't get a very good view of it as well. Yeah. There's some, like, issues with the visualization. Like, you think it's deep enough, but actually from, like, what I can see there, yeah, there's still some distance there, yeah. And when the distance is correct, maybe you're, like, to the side of it. It's quite difficult. Yeah, yeah. And it's interesting, like, the drawing you mentioned, so it's kind of like a different type of task, basically. Yeah, yeah. Because the other one, you try to reach one position, but with the drawing, you care about the path to the position. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Cool, yeah, that's it. Okay. All done. I will give you a... Thank you so much."
P16_after4,"The last task? Yeah. So I guess first of all, with those last two tasks, how did you feel compared to the other reaching tasks? Were they more difficult? Were they easier? Yeah, it was a little bit more difficult because it required to close the fingers and maintain your position in the same plane. But yeah, it was very interesting as well to try new things. Yeah, yeah, that's great. Which part, I guess other aspects, depth for instance, did you find that to be a factor that made it more difficult? Yeah, yeah. Like I guess what you were mentioning, like with the drawing, it's like discontinuous. Exactly, yeah. I guess I wanted to do it continuously, but yeah, probably, yeah, as you said, I was maybe like, yeah, getting off the plane, yeah, and so yeah, it's hard to stay in the same plane. The drawing was more difficult, but yeah, it was very interesting. Awesome. And then I guess finally, just in general, to move the robot, what sort of strategy did you use? Because it was like rotated, right? Yeah. Okay, yeah. So how did you think? So actually, I rotated my head in my mind. Okay. So like, I was trying to do like that. So you imagine yourself like that? Exactly. Okay. Awesome. So I imagine, yeah, myself like that. And then yeah, it was easier that way. Yes. Right. Cool. Yeah. Awesome, awesome. Yeah. "
P20_exploratory,"yeah yeah so I guess with firstly like did you find those two activities to be more difficult than the reaching yeah the first one that I have to grab something is easier than the second one okay yeah yeah okay so I guess the the easy easiness of the first task or like even the reaching task comes from but it's only a position like whereas the drawing you have to maintain that we mean I maintain the path yeah yeah okay that's interesting cool and then I guess did you also find other aspects of the task to be difficult you like with the drawing I draw, it's like, it's really sensitive to the motion that I done and when I want to make like a line it's like sometimes it's like not touch the, because it's like, you don't know how far yeah and it's very sensitive yeah yeah I guess the actually the most one of the most difficult parts of this setup apart from the rotation is just like but you don't have good depth perception you're not sure how far you are in this direction that's always quite difficult even with augmented reality still quite difficult yeah cool and I guess finally I think you mentioned before but like what was your strategy to controlling the arm because it's rotated right it's very weird so I think previously you mentioned that you I just just think about the formula it's like if you want to move the robot up you have to move like right and things like this okay all right cool all right that's it okay thank you so much"
P23_after4,"Yeah, cool, I guess you can also read the question, but basically the first one asks, do you think like this rendering was helpful in helping control the arm? Yeah, I think not the first one, but for the second and third one, especially for the third one, it's most helpful. Right, okay, so firstly, you prefer the human arms over the robot arm? Yeah. Yeah, is there a reason? Do you think of a reason you think? I just feel like the first one is basically the same on the right, so it doesn't help. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't provide me any information, but for the human arm, it's kind of like I can't see my arm right here, but I can see my arm performing something. Right, okay, great. And then you mentioned that the vertical one was better than the horizontal? Yeah. Yeah, and do you have a reason for that? I'm not sure. So when I'm performing the test, I'm imagining the whole target 90 degrees. Oh, I see. In another position, you know, it's not, yeah, it's on the other rotation. And so it's better for me to use the rotated arm to choose. I see, so it's kind of like, it's convenient to help you check physically. Yeah. Because it's in the same orientation as the robot. Yeah. And also the target, pretty much. Yeah, I'm imagining the target. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's all. Can you please just write this for me? I think you can just click and drag them. I guess I can also do it. Because I'm, so you want the vertical human arm. Is that correct? Yeah. Vertical, so human arms first. Okay. Yes. All right. And any extra feedback if you want to? Just about this, like this part of the task in general. Yeah, that's okay. We actually have like, the two activities afterwards, we'll have another discussion in general about the entire stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, one thing is these two distances cannot distract me, maybe. I'm not sure how to keep this closer. Yeah, that is a good point. So like, they are not, I guess, they're like on the side. It's a bit weird. Yeah, so this can't provide me any information because it's so far."
P23_exploratory,"Yeah, you can say whatever you want. Yeah, so firstly, so how difficult were those two tasks compared with the previous one, like more difficult, less difficult? Yeah, I think more difficult, because the first one is 3D, and I have to grip it. It's not something that happens in the experiment. Sure. And for the third one, it's hard to keep the hand in a plate. Yeah. So I think that's difficult for the second one. The depth direction, yeah, it's probably the most difficult. Even like, I think any virtual or like these virtual renderings is quite difficult to perceive. That's why we had the line initially for the target reaching task. Yeah, why is the line missing here? Yeah, I don't know. Forgot to add. To add some difficulty here. Yeah, that would be nice. But I think the crayon might block it. Yeah. But yeah, we definitely agree, like some depth perception would be nice. Yeah, and so you mentioned that basically the control strategy you developed is you try to rotate the target in your head. Is that how? Yeah. Do you imagine yourself lying down, or you try to rotate the targets? And imagine like working here. Just trying to reach the rotated target. I see. So you rotate the targets first. Yeah. I can imagine it's another target. I see. Mapping with this one. So I'm trying to use my hand to reach the virtual target. Yeah, so like as an example, if the target was the top one, then you imagine it's the right one. Also because it's round, so it's easier to imagine. OK. So I don't need to change it. The position is already here. And I just need to turn the right one to another thing. OK. All right, cool. That's it. All good."
P2_after4,"Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Because... I thought it would be easier but I don't think it's quite the blocking. Yeah, if you are in the back, the robot will block everything. Yeah, because it's kind of big. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. So, I'm done, right? Yep."
P3_after4,"There was not a screen in front of the control arm and the task is still this two, so I just look at this. Okay. That's fine. But did you find any of the conditions helpful? No? The same? No. Not really? So I guess you only focus on the main task in the gripper? Yes. All the time. That's fine."
P6_after4,"Okay, yeah, so we did those four different conditions. Did you feel that the virtual rendering here was helpful at all? No, I didn't use it. So you didn't use it at all, yeah. What about in the initial round? I guess in the initial round you had no virtual rendering. The second one maybe, do you feel like it was, like with the vertical arm, was it, did you maybe glance over it at all or you just didn't use it, okay. No, I didn't use it. Right, so your, I guess your approach to the task is just to look directly there and, yeah. I looked at the vertical arm. Yeah, so you look at the real robot arm, okay, cool. What about like the depth perception, would you feel about the depth, was it, did you have some trouble there or do you think the line was helpful? Yeah, I think the line was helpful. Yeah, yeah, because the position I guess is. Yeah, if I didn't see the line, I know that I'm reaching too far. Ah, okay, yeah, so you can kind of feel also, so you basically feel like there's also a workspace kind of here, right, like when you can also. Yeah, and finally, that's it, okay, we'll do the fine activities now."
P6_exploratory,"Yeah, so I guess like, how did you find those two activities compared to like the previous task of just like reaching like multiple? Much more harder. Much more harder, okay. Much more harder. Would you say like maybe in those activities like the virtual rendering will help or not really? I didn't even notice there is something here. Ah, okay, okay. Yeah. No, no, no. So there wasn't. There wasn't in the final two, yeah. And so you mentioned something about the depth in the drawing. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the hardest part. I didn't know where to start at that point. Right, yeah. Yeah, I think based on like how we designed it, it's similar to like the reaching, if you get within like 10 centimeters or maybe 5 centimeters. Yeah. And the other thing is I guess when you, like when we draw, we actually have like some force upward. Yeah. Yeah. Would you say that would also help? Like force feedback? Like haptic. Yeah. Yeah. I can't really see the difference. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right. That's it. All done."
P7_after4,"Okay, I guess you can also read the question, but the first one asks, do you think the augmented reality? The arms were helpful for you in controlling the arm and the body. Yeah. Yeah, it was quite, yeah, it was controlling the, I was able to control the arm of Philip Yeah, it was quite helpful and augmented reality was good in controlling, you know, the robot of the arm. So it was performing well. Okay, I see. Yep. And the second one is, do you think it was more helpful with the virtual arm in the same orientation with the actual robot or to your arm? Yeah, I think it was more helpful when the orientation of the robot was quite similar to the orientation of my hand. So it was quite easier then to perform the tasks. Right. So if you were to compare the two cases where you had the yellow human arm, but one was like here, one was like this, which one was the horizontal? The horizontal one was quite easier and helpful in detecting the target. Okay. All right. Awesome. What was the last one? Do you think it was more helpful seeing a virtual human arm or seeing a virtual robot arm? Yeah. Yeah, I think the virtual robot arm was quite helpful. If you were to pick one though, between the human arms or the robot arms? Yeah, the human arm was more helpful. Right, right. Do you have some reasons why? Any thoughts? Yeah, because I was able to, you know, exactly monitor the, you know, movement of my arm. Virtual arm was, you know, convenient. Okay. Convenient to, I guess, to check and... Yeah. Awesome. Cool. Yeah, guys, you can rank. So no hologram is the condition we did first. There's nothing. And yeah, you can see the horizontal human, vertical human, and horizontal robot. So you just click and you can drag. Thank you. Okay. I'll just go for it."
P7_exploratory,"Yeah, so we can just talk about it. So yeah, I guess compared to the previous target selection task, were the grasping or this drawing task easier, harder? Yeah, it was a bit harder than the previous one. Right. Maybe it's because I had more practice on selecting the target. So for that task, I didn't have much practice. So maybe if I have to, if I have a practice, I am sure that it will also be easier one. But yeah, the previous one was quite easy because I had a lot of practice in there. A lot of repetition. Yeah. Yeah, more repetition. Interesting. And then I guess with the grasping or the drawing, did you find the depth difficult? Like the depth direction? A bit difficult. Yeah. Yeah, it was a bit difficult compared to the previous tasks. Yeah. What kind of information would you think, if shown, would help with that? Yeah, I think when I was trying to grasp the object, I was able to see only one line. Okay. So I think there should be two lines for the two fingers. Oh. So that when you move it, so there should be two lines. And when the two lines hit the perimeter of the object, so you just close it and then grasp it. So it would be quite helpful because when I was trying to move it, there was only one line. So I wasn't able to quickly know that whether my hands had touched the perimeter, the outer surface of the object or not. So I think, in my opinion, there should be two lines of pointing these two fingers. Yeah. And when you move it, so when you see both the lines are touching the outer perimeter of the object, you just close it and grasp it. So I think it will work. Right. That could be one amendment, in my opinion. Yeah, yeah. The only thing I was, you know, it was very difficult for me to find out whether I had touched the perimeter or not. Yeah, okay. That's why it took a bit more time than the previous tasks. Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Thank you. That's very good feedback. You're the first one to point it out, actually. No one mentioned the two lines. But actually, it makes sense, right? Yeah. Two lines. When you have only one line, you don't know whether your fingers have touched the upper surface. So if you have two lines going here, and you see, okay, these two lines are hitting the outer perimeter of the object, just grab it. Yeah. So that would work, I think. Okay. Same for the writing as well, when you are drawing something. So there should be a line that should follow your one finger, only one finger, right? Okay. Because usually when you are trying to write, you don't use the other finger. Yeah. So just, it should be like all the other fingers should be closed. Yeah. If your lefty are handy, right-handed, so just use it like this, and it should be quite convenient. It was a bit difficult to, you know, perfectly write. Yeah. I wasn't able to write perfectly, to be honest. Yeah. So there should be a line, and when you do like this, it should start writing. So there should be some indication, like now it's starting to write. Yeah. There was no indication like now it's starting to write or not. Yeah. Because you don't know how far you are. Yeah. For instance, if I just go there, so there should be indication that now it is going to start writing, right? Yeah. And then, yeah, just follow like this. I think there should be one more thing related to this one. Awesome. So these two things can, I think, improve the later tasks. Yeah. In my opinion. Yeah. Okay, that's great. Yeah, and then just in general, going back to the previous task, or like just in general, did you develop some kind of control strategy, like because you practiced with like just reaching? Yeah, I think the... What's your strategy? When I was doing in the beginning, so I was not using my mind properly, like I was just moving hands like this. Yeah. So when I realized that, when you move, actually you need to understand the orientation of your arm. Yeah. For instance, when I was moving left, it was moving down. Exactly, yeah. So you should actually clearly know about this thing. When you are good at knowing that when you move left, the robot arm will move down. So when you are clear about this, it will be very faster then. So in the beginning, I was not, to be honest, sure. Yeah. So I was just doing like this. Yeah. But in the later stages, when I got to know that when you go left, the hands will move down. Yeah. So actually, the user should, you know, carefully know about the movement of your arm and the movement of the robot arm. Yeah. So when you are clear about this, then it becomes quite easy. Quite easy, okay. Yeah. So I think the orientation of the robot arm and your arm should be well understood by the user. Then it's quite easy. Yeah. And that's why you might have observed that in the third or fourth practice. Yeah. I was like doing quite fast. Quite fast, yes, definitely. Yeah. So these were the things which can improve quite a bit. Okay, awesome. Yeah, that's the end of the study. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you very much."
P8_after4,"Because that was regarding the last condition was. In this condition, the arm is in the same position as the robot arm. Yeah, but it was like the human arm. Yes. Yeah, human arm but in the. The position of the arm. Right. Do you know why you think that? How did it make you feel? It was the most helpful. It looks like it was like, well, I had more practice. I think it also could affect that. But I feel like I could see the arm in my very, very own view. So I tried to mimic the movement of the VR arm. I think that the position and it's a little bit. The drawing of the arm is like more, the schematics is less complicated or it's easy for me to understand. Yeah, yeah. So compared to the complete arm, the robotic arm, with all the articulation. I don't know how to move it, but how to move my arm, I know how to move my arm. Yeah, that's a very interesting point. So I guess because what you mean is like the robot has like maybe six, seven links. Yes, and you don't, you are trying to understand how each part of. Yeah. But in contrast with the VR arm, because in the position of the robot arm was like, it was more simple to understand how to. Right. Yeah, yeah, definitely, no. Actually, I completely agree with you. Like when I tried to set up myself, it's exactly that. I found that to be the most helpful, especially for, because you did the condition last. But I tried it first, and it was very helpful for learning it. Yes. Yeah, yeah, that's what I found, yeah. Thank you so much for that insight. Yeah. Oh. You can just type a yes. Okay, you basically answered that, so you can just type yes. Yeah. The third one, it's more helpful, virtual arm. You also answered that, yeah. No problem. Yeah. And the final one, I think just the ranking. I think as long as you press and then drag. I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. "
P8_exploratory,"Okay, so yeah, I guess the final two tasks, like the picking, grasping, and also the drawing, how do they compare in terms of difficulty with the pointing task? Was it more difficult, less difficult? They were more difficult. More difficult, yeah. More specific reasons, maybe? Any reasons? I think it requires more precision with the movements. And also the... I think with a little bit more practice I could grab a little bit more precise movements, but it's also because the arm is in a position different with my arm, and I cannot completely... And also I think the perception also is... Ah, like the depth, or like the distance. Yeah, yeah. I think especially probably for the drawing task, right? Yes. It's hard to know, because we know how we set it up, so it's like... I remember you said the threshold, but for the users it's hard to know the distance. I guess your previous point that you mentioned, like with the human arm, but in a vertical direction. Yes. Do you think that would... Because it helps a little bit more, because you can see the arm, and you can have a... On your peripheral view you can see how the arm, the virtual arm is moving, so you can correct the movement of your arm. So it will, for example, if I want to move it to the right, or a little bit come back to my body, so I can adjust the movement of my arm, it's like seeing your own arm movement. So you ignore the position of your arm, and you see the position of the... Even, I think, if you can try to find a way to put the VR arm on top of the real robot arm, it would help a little bit more. I don't know. Ah, that's interesting. So you mean like a... Super cold position of the... But directly on top of the actual... I think that was actually the original idea we had, but then we were thinking maybe it's visually too much. So we moved it to here. But you think it's maybe more helpful? Maybe more helpful, yeah. It's interesting. I don't know yet, but... Sure. I can... That's interesting. You can try. Yeah, yeah. Good. Awesome. Yeah. Cool, okay, yeah. That's it. That's everything."
