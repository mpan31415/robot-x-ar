Transcript:
Speaker 1 
Yeah, so just we can talk about it. So yeah, I guess compare to the previous target selection task, were the grasping or this drawing task e easier? Harder?

Speaker 2 
Yeah, it was a bit harder than the previous one, right? Maybe it's because I had more practice on selecting the targets. So for that task, I didn't have much access. Maybe if I have to, I if I have a practice, you know, I am sure that it will also be easier one. But yeah, yeah, the previous one was quite easier because I had a lot of fact practice, a lot of repetition.

Speaker 1 
More repetition. That's why interesting. And then I guess with the grasping or the drawing, did you find the depth difficult, right? The depth direction a bit difficult, but.

Speaker 2 
Yeah, yeah, it was a bit difficult compared to the previous classes.

Speaker 1 
How, how, like, what kind of information like would you think like if shown would.

Speaker 2 
Help with? Yeah, I think the when I was trying to grasp the object, yeah, I was able to see only one line. Okay, but I think there should be two lines for the two fingers. So that deflection when you move it. Yeah, so there should be two lines. And when the two lines hit the parameter of the object, yeah, so you just close it at that graph. So it would be quite helpful because when I was trying to move it, there was only one line. So I wasn't able to, you know, quickly know that whether it my hands and touch the parameter, the outer surface of surface object or not. So I think in my opinion, there should be two lines of pointing these two fingers. And when you move it, so when you see both the lines are touching the outer parameter of the object. Yeah, you just close it and press it. So I think it will work in right? That could be one amendment in my opinion. That was the only thing I was, you know, it was very difficult for me to find out whether I had touched the parameter or.

Speaker 1 
Not. Yeah, okay. So that's why it took a bit more time than the previous task. Awesome. Thank you. That's very good feedback. You're the first one to point it out. Actually, no one mentioned the two lines, but actually it makes sense, right? Yeah, I.

Speaker 2 
Think two lines when you have only one line, you don't know whether you have, yeah, fingers have touched the upper surface. So if you have two lines going in and you see, okay, these two lines are hitting the outer parameter of the okay display. Yeah, so that would work, I think. Okay, same for the writing as well when you're trying something. So there should be a line that should follow your one finger, only one finger, right? Okay. Because usually when you're trying to write, you don't feel the other finger. Yeah, so just it should be like all the other places should be closed. And if your lefty handy, right handed, yeah. So then just use it like this and it should be quite convenient. So it was a bit more difficult to, you know, perfectly right. Yeah, I wasn't able to write perfectly, to be honest. So it, there should be a line and when you do like this, it should start writing. So there should be some indication like now it's starting to write. Yeah, it was there was no indication like now it's starting to write or not.

Speaker 1 
Yeah, cuz you know, like, like, you don't know how far you.

Speaker 2 
Are. First, for instance, if I just go there, so there should be indication that now it is going to start writing, right? And then, yeah, just follow like this. I think there should be one more thing related to this one also. So these two things can, I can improve the later.

Speaker 1 
Tasks. Okay, that's great. And then just in general, the pre going back to the previous task, or like just in general, did you develop some kind of control strategy? Like because you practiced with like just reaching.

Speaker 2 
Yeah, I think the.

Speaker 1 
What's your strategy.

Speaker 2 
When I was doing in the beginning. So I will not be using my mind properly like that. Okay, just moving hands and like this. Yeah, so when I realize that when you move for actually you need to understand the orientation of your arm. Yeah, for instance, when I was moving left, so it was moving down. Exactly. Yeah, so you should actually clearly know about this thing when you are good at knowing that when you move left, yeah, the robot arm will move down. So when you are clear about this, it will be very fast of that. So in the beginning, I was not, to be honest, sure. So I was just learning like this. But in the later stages when I got to know that, when you both, yeah, the hand will move down. So actually the user should, you know, carefully know about the movement of your arm and the movement of the robot arm. Yeah, so when you are clear about this benefit, it becomes cohesive.

Speaker 1 
Okay.

Speaker 2 
So I think the orientation of the bow term and your arm should be well understood by the user. The next criteria. Yeah, then that's why you might have observed that in the third or fourth practice.

Speaker 1 
No, quite fast. Yes, definitely.

Speaker 2 
So this was the feedback which can improve.

Speaker 1 
Okay. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, that's the end of the study. Okay. Okay. Thank you very.
