Speaker 1 00:02 
Yeah, I guess you can also read if you want, but basically, it's pretty much asking if the like the virtual rendering here helped at all with the task. Maybe not all of them helped. And yeah, if you have any comments on any of them, you can just like we can discuss.

Speaker 2 00:20 
So the first one, I think a little bit, but actually most of the time I wasn't looking at though.Okay.Yes, focusing on the dots actually. But when I see that the arm and this arm is in the same direction, I just feel it.

Speaker 1 00:39 
But you mean the human arm, but in a vertical direction.

Speaker 2 00:44 
The virtual arm, in this arm, I mean, I think the second one, when you match it with the same second or third, when you match with the same angle, it looks the same. When it, yeah, the angle of this arm and gender arm is like the same. Yeah, so it feels more how much I think it feels more.

Speaker 1 01:00 
Secure when I try to adjust my movement. Okay, yeah. So you were you using that one at all? Like maybe to like to check, just check, just.

Speaker 2 01:10 
To check them. They check, but most of the time I wasn't looking at.

Speaker 1 01:14 
Okay, that's interesting.

Speaker 2 01:19 
So the second question is, yes. And then David, looking over to virtual.

Speaker 1 01:24 
Team, I see virtual. Oh yeah, so the yellow arm was like the human arm. Okay, so that was the vertical one. Like, and then we showed one condition of the robot arm. I'm just in this direction.

Speaker 2 01:37 
The yellow one was the first.

Speaker 1 01:39 
One, yellow. So the first and the second was for the yellow armor. Okay. I think it's a yellow. Amazing. So the human on, do you know maybe why do you have a reason for that code?

Speaker 2 01:52 
I don't know. It just feelings. I mean, because when I was doing the experiment, I actually know that it's a yellow.

Speaker 1 01:58 
Army. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, no reason. Okay, no worries. Ranking. Yeah, it's just ranking. You can you see? Yeah, if you feel like the. So I think if you mention the, so yeah, so vertical human arm, if you think that's the one what you mentioned, like you felt more secure for the top reaches the car. It's also the yellow arm, but in the horizontal, I think it was the personal former.

Speaker 1 02:45 
Okay, thank you. So yeah, I will type the rest just I'll just type yes. But yeah, thanks for the verbal feedback. That's very helpful. But this is Anthony by doing. Okay, which does you're doing now? Exploratory now. Okay, understand. Yes, very good. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
